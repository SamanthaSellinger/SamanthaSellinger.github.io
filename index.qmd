Hello and welcome to my website!

I am a fifth year student at the University of Ottawa, completing a major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science for Scientists. I am also a part-time employee at Statistics Canada, and member of the Statistics Canada R/Python User Group.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with my cat, reading, or working out!
